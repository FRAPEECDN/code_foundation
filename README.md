# code_foundation
The coding foundation is just some projects exploring the foundation of coding and some practice small code examining how to do some features.

# Language used for coding
The languages being used is C++ and Java (for now)
Planning to add C# as well
C++ is mostly based on modern c++ using standard 11, 14, 17 and 20 (some of 17 and 20 may not fully work yet)
Java is to be used as Java 21 for now. 

## Foundation
The foundation projects is basic foundation of programming and showcase
1. Primitive data types 
2. Functions (subroutines) with parameter and return values
3. Conditional Statements (Type of if, and switch)
4. Loops (while, do .. while, for, for each)
5. Arrays
6. Sorting and searching in arrays
7. How some basic collection work to assist points 5 and 6.
8. Unit Testing (Java -> Junit, C++ both CppUnitTestFramework and GTest)
9. Encoding process example (String to number and back)
10. Call back functionality (C++ traditional + std), Java -> Interface
11. ASync execution requests

### Examples
The examples files are specific implementation of some coding including ADT (Adavance Data Types) and both
static and dynamic polymorphism.
The examples are
- ADT (Plain Objects, Enum (Java number + strings), struct/record)
- Under ADT it also include some Date and Time handling
- Console application for input and output, with input validation
- File input and output - Includes regular expression and remapping
- Use of regular expressions
- Simple mapping of values

### Database Examples
The examples for database interaction using C++ and Java has been added. C++ uses direct libraries and Java uses JDBC DataSource with prepared statements.
Note there is readme files for C++ due to installation work that is required
Database being covered
- SQLite
- PostgresSQL

### Comparison of memory structures
